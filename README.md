# qbels

A simple tree-sitter based lsp implementation for [Quick Backend (QBE) IR](https://c9x.me/compile/).

There is no support for multiple files, everything is on a per-file basis.

## Features

- [X] Rename
- [X] Go to Definition
- [X] Find references
- [ ] Autocomplete
- [ ] Hover (I'd like to show documentation for hovered instruction)
